TSWeChat - A [WeChat](https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/wei/id414478124) alternative, updated to Swift 5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[中文说明](Chinese_README.md)

## Requirements
- [Cocoapods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods) 1.2.0 +
- iOS 10.0+ / Mac OS X 10.9+
- Xcode 10.0+


## Features
- Send your rich text, expression, image and voice.
- The cell image in `TSChatImageCell` is drawn by using `Mask Layer` . The chat background can be changed freely so that UI will look perfect.
- Custom expression keyboard, custom tool keyboard.
- Audio `wav` files can be automatically converted into `amr` files which facilite file transfer to Android devices. Both of the two type files have been doing cache.
- When you tap the `TSChatVoiceCell`. It will automatically check the cache and download it by [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire). 
- When you send the image, it will be stored locally by using the caching mechanism of [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher). After successfully uploaded, it will be automatically modified to image link's `MD5` value file name.
- The data are loaded from the JSON file. All the `Models` are created via [ObjectMapper](https://github.com/Hearst-DD/ObjectMapper) which is easy to convert model objects (classes and structs) from JSON.



## Preview
Run `pod install` in the `Terminal` and then run `TSWeChat.xcworkspace` to see all the views.<br><br>
